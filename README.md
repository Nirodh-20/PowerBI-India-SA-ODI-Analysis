# PowerBI-India-SA-ODI-Analysis
This project helped me deepen my understanding of Power BI data modeling, DAX, and Power Query transformation techniques, while also making cricket data come alive through dynamic visuals. 🏏📊
Here’s how I approached the project:



 🔹 Data Extraction: Imported data directly from ESPN StatsGuru webpages. Each category — Batting, Bowling, and Fielding — had three separate pages, which I appended into unified datasets using Power Query.

 🔹 Data Cleaning: Processed and refined the datasets by assigning proper data types, replacing invalid values, and removing irrelevant columns to ensure data accuracy.

 🔹 Data Modeling & DAX: Created calculated columns and used DAX RANKX and other functions to derive key insights, such as average run deviation and strike rate categories.

 🔹 Visualization: Built interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize player performance trends, batting consistency, and overall team comparisons.
